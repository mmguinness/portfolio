### My name is Marie Mc Guinness, I'm a Dublin-based junior software engineer and architect, who loves designing and building things, recently with code. 

I have contributed on a wide range of [project types](https://mmguinness.github.io/portfolio/portfolio/2022/06/05/Architecture-portfolio.html), most recently working with Metropolitan Workshop on the residential redevelopment of [Cromcastle Court and the Old Coal Yard](https://mmguinness.github.io/portfolio/CV/#employment) for Dublin City Council. After graduating from Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street I moved to London for 4 years, where I worked in the education sector on specialist school buildings.

When Covid hit, suddenly I had a completely new routine. Every morning instead of commuting I would go for a walk in Phoenix Park with my brother, he became my new colleague in a roundabout way. Through our conversations I learnt about what a software developer does day-to-day, and how creative the process is. As a person who looks for efficiency and appreciates well designed things, I was intrigued.

Working in architecture involves a lot of information, including 2D and 3D representations of designs, my roles frequently had me exploring new software to achieve this. Back in 2016 I had looked into Python, which can be used in conjunction with architecture software, like Autodesk Revit, to automate processes and build more complex things. Some if/else statements are as far as I got at this point. It was only when I understood the workflow and design processes that go into developing and maintaining code, I began to see the possibilities.

Once I heard about someone who had completely changed their career through a coding bootcamp, I began to think that this was something I could do. After a few months of teaching myself to code via online resources, I knew this was what I wanted to do and culminated in my decision to join the selective Markers Academy bootcamp.
