<br>

### My name is Marie Mc Guinness, I'm a Dublin-based software developer and former architect, who loves designing and building things, more recently with code. 

<br>

After graduating in 2011 with a BArch (Hons) Architecture from Dublin Institute of Technology, I moved to London where I worked in the education sector on specialist school buildings. In 2017 I returned to Dublin and have contributed on a wide range of [project types](https://mmguinness.github.io/portfolio/architecture/2022/06/05/Architecture-portfolio.html). 

<br>

In 2021 I decided to take a break from the architecture industry. After a few months of teaching myself to code via online resources, I knew a change of career into software development was what I wanted to do and culminated in my decision to join Makers Academy bootcamp.

<br>

As part of the January 2022 cohort, I completed Makers Academy and I am currently working in my first role as a software developer.
