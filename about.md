<strong>I'm a Dublin-based junior full stack developer and registered architect, who loves designing and building things, recently with code.<strong>

I have worked on a wide range of project types and architecture offices, most recently working with Metropolitan Workshop on the redevelopment of [Cromcastle Court and the Old Coal Yard](https://mmguinness.github.io/portfolio/CV/#employment) for Dublin City Council. I have experience leading construction projects including design, coordination and management.

After graduating from Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street I moved to London for 4 years, where I began my career as an architectural assistant. I completed my postgraduate diploma in Professional Practice in the University of Westminster prior to returning to Dublin in 2017.

When Covid hit, suddenly I had a completely new routine. Every morning instead of commuting I would go for a walk in Phoenix Park with my brother, he became my new colleague in a roundabout way. He works in software development and through our conversations I learnt about what he does day-to-day, and how creative the process is. As a person who looks for efficiency and appreciates well designed things, I was intrigued.

Working in architecture involves a lot of drawings and 3D representations of designs, my roles frequently had me exploring new software to achieve this. Back in 2016 I had looked into Python, which can be used in conjunction with architecture software, like Autodesk Revit, to automate processes and build more complex things. Unfortunately, some if/else statements are as far as I got. It was only when I understood the workflow and design processes that go into developing and maintaining code, I began to see the possibilities.

Once I heard about someone who had completely changed their career through a coding bootcamp, I began to think that this was something I could do. After a few months of teaching myself to code via online resources, I knew this was what I wanted to do for my career, culminating in my decision to join the selective Markers Academy bootcamp.

I am looking for a career that lets me work on interesting new projects and continue to learn.
