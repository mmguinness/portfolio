I'm a former architect who loves building things with code.

When Covid hit, suddenly I had a completely new routine. Every morning instead of commuting I would go for a walk in Phoenix Park with my brother, he became my new colleague in a roundabout way. He works in software development and through our conversations I learnt about what he does day-to-day, and how things work in the tech industry. As a person who looks for efficiency and appreciates well designed things, I was intrigued.

In 2016 I had looked into Python, which can be used in conjunction with architecture software, like Autodesk Revit, to automate processes and build more complex things. Unfortunately, some if/else statements are as far as I got. It was only when I understood the workflow and design processes that go into developing and maintaining code that I began to see the attraction.

When I heard about someone who had completely changed their career through a coding bootcamp, I began to think that this was something I could do. After a few months of self-teaching, I knew this was what I wanted to do for my career. So, I signed up for the Makers Academy Bootcamp and put all my energy into it. I was coding every day, even on weekends.

I'm now seeking a full-time role where I can grow further and can contribute my skills both in coding and design to help a company achieve their goals.
