**[Haverstock Architects](http://haverstock.com/)**  
_Sep 2012 to Aug 2015_

Haverstock works closely with clients, creating designs to meet their needs, and inspiring buildings to enhance peopleâ€™s lives. I assisted with the full scope of work on educational projects including a SEN School in Poole, and a [Primary School & Childrens Centre in Islington, London](http://haverstock.com/project/moreland-school/).
