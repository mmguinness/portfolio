[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) is an immersive 16-week full-stack software engineering bootcamp. I was a student in the January 2022 Cohort. Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mmguinness) to see all the projects I worked on during my time at Makers.

Having recently graduated, I created this site to document new coding projects and show a little of my previous experience in architecture.


Below are some free **online courses which I completed before joining Makers Academy**. I would recommend these to anyone interested in learning to code. I found Udemy the easiest place to start, as the video content much more engaging and easier to understand to start off with. 

* Introduction to Coding with Ruby - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/newbie-to-ruby/) <br>
* 100 minute Tutorial on Ruby - [Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) <br>
* Responsive Web Design - [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design) <br>
* Learn Ruby - [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) <br>

Alongside these courses I found [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) a really fun and challenging way to get stuck into using Ruby, my first computer language. It also naturally led me to set up my own Ruby programming environment, so I could work on the challenges outside the website. This helped me get familiar with text editors, the command line, IRB (a Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and runnning small programs to see how my code was working.
