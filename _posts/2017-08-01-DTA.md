_Aug 2017 to Oct 2019_

My focus was to develop detailed Tender and Construction information for a hotel located in a complex urban block in Dublin inner city. The drawings were produced with Vectorworks 3D, including details for a bespoke facade with a mix of folded metal cladding, brickwork and precast concrete elements, take a look at the finished building in google street view below.
