_Architect (Aug 2017 to Oct 2019)_

My focus was to develop detailed Tender and Construction information for a hotel located in a complex urban block in Dublin inner city. The drawings were produced with Vectorworks 3D, including details for a bespoke facade with a mix of folded metal cladding, brickwork and precast concrete elements, [take a look at the finished building in google street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@53.3451004,-6.2513933,3a,75y,239.76h,108.2t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slEvi_KxnqIc07cSEGZGxPA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).
