It has been a really useful exercise for me to pick apart a template project from my time at Makers Academy, and build it back up again piece by piece. Doing this for my [book club project](https://github.com/mmguinness/remote-book-club) has helped my understanding of why everything in the tech stack is there and what it is doing. Takeaways on what I have done so far:

1.  **Everything takes longer than expected**, leave lots of time to explore unexpected things you encounter along the way, such as [pagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination).

2.   For future projects I would recommend **researching the stack you want to use in detail beforehand** and attempt to set that up from the start. There is no benefit to reinventing the wheel. As someone who likes to build things from scratch, it is a shift in mindset to take advantage of what already works, avoid repetition and focus on how I want to apply this system to my project instead.

3. **JavaScript**, I took some time to work through the JavaScript module on freeCodeCamp to fill in any gaps in my knowledge and refresh my ES5 syntax. I overestimated how easily I could transition between Ruby and JS. Adding another 50 points to my total in codewars really helps me with the transition and gaining a fluency to using the language.

## Project update

MVP has been achieved, and I am working through the additional features.

The next big step is to move what I do have completed from running locally in development onto Heroku and a MongoDB Atlas database.
