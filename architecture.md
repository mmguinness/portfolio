Before moving into software development, I would make my portfolio with paper, as a little bound booklet. There is something really satisfying about seeing the work presented on paper. 

Below I have taken my previous portfolio, a selection of professional and student projects, and re-presented it for online viewing using simple HTML and CSS styling. [Reference](https://codepen.io/lynnandtonic/pen/PoZpjOr)
