Before moving into software development, I would make my portfolio with paper, as a little bound booklet. Below I have taken my previous architecture portfolio, a selection of professional and student projects, and re-presented it for online viewing using simple HTML and CSS styling. Styling tips referenced from [here](https://codepen.io/lynnandtonic/pen/PoZpjOr).
