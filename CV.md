I’m a former architect who loves designing and building things, and a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) coding bootcamp. I bring a keen eye for detail, project planning, full-life-cycle thinking and iterative working methods. So far in my career, I have learnt to contribute and lead on large complex projects, working closely with design teams, consultants, building-contractors, clients, stakeholders and the public. I am looking for a career that lets me work on interesting new projects and continue to learn.

## Tech Experience

[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) **16 week immersive full-stack engineering bootcamp** with a strong focus on:

- Language agnostic process for learning

- Software craftsmanship: SOLID, OPP, TDD, BDD
- Group projects & pair programming
- Coding reviews _(live tech test of TDD process)_
- Agile methodologies and XP values

I am a visual thinker, one of my favourite parts of Makers has been discovering a new type of diagram almost every week. When stuck on a problem or short on time, I lean on diagramming and planning. For example in my [Chitter API](https://github.com/mmguinness/frontend-api-challenge/blob/master/images/Object_Model_Diagram_02.png) weekend challenge.
